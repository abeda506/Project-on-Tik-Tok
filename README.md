# Project-on-Tik-Tok
The data team of TikTok is developing a machine-learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform. 
Scenario: As a data analyst on TikTok's data team, I have prepared the data needed for the claims classification project. To do this, I have built a data frame, organized the claims data for the process of exploratory data analysis, and therefore updated the team on the insights and progress. 
In this project, the following tasks are fulfilled:
1. Build a data frame for the TikTok dataset
2. Read data from TikTok csv file
3. Display rows within the data frame
4. Explore and examine the data type of each column
I have used Python in Jupyter Notebook throughout the project.
